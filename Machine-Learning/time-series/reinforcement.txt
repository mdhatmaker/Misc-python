1) Gamification
- Computer games in their simplest form have:
    - state
    - cursor movement
    - reward
- For a trading game this would be equivalent to:
    - Historical and current prices, technical data and alternative sources
    - Buy/Sell/Do Nothing
    - PnL

2) How To Train The System?
- Each entry and exit is an individual game
- Run through the price series sequentially or randomly
- Make the whole price series one single game
- Train on each instrument separately or on all with the same learner

3) Reward Function Design
- Pure PnL on exit, otherwise zero
- PnL from start of trade to every time step t
- PnL per tick
- Punishment for long hold times
- Alternatives to PnL:
    - Recognition of trading direction
    - Recognition of correct regime
