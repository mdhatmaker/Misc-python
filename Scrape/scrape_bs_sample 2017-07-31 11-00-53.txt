You Won&#8217;t Believe These Films Where The Actors Really Hooked Up

The Motion Picture Production Code and US law restricted real, unsimulated intimate encounters in movies until the 1960s, when mainstream cinemas began pushing boundaries in terms of what was presented on screen. Though most graphic love acts depicted in movies are simulated, sometimes actors actually perform the real deeds. According to Wikipedia, &#8220;the difference between these films and pornography is that, while such scenes might be considered erotic, the intent of these films is not solely pornographic.&#8221; Here are some notable real-life bonk scenes that left many a movie-goer&#8217;s glasses steamed over.

Risky Business (1983)

This one has never been confirmed by the film&#8217;s stars, but rumors have been swirling for years about Risky Business. The speculation surrounds that infamously steamy scene on the train between Tom Cruise and his then real-life girlfriend Rebecca De Mornay. Some think the scene might have featured some very real action. While this might seem questionable given the fact that it would have been a very risky move for a huge star like Tom Cruise, one thing is for sure: the chemistry between these two was very very real! De Mornay went on to become a star herself after this role, appearing in blockbuster films like Backdraft and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle

Ken Park (2002)

Ken Park is a 2002 erotic drama film based on the writings and journals of Larry Clark (who directed the controversial film Kids). Ken Park was written by Harmony Korine, and it follows the lives of several California teenagers.
One of the characters has an ongoing scandalous relationship with his girlfriend&#8217;s mother. He continues to socialize with her family, who, like his girlfriend, are completely unaware of the affair. The boinking scenes in this film are all awkward, all real, and all completely unsimulated. Due to the graphic nature of the intimacy depicted in Ken Park, the film was banned in Australia and remains so to this day.

Baise-moi (2000)

Baise-moi is a crime thriller film starring Karen Lancaume and Raffa&#235;la Anderson The French title Baise-moi is an ambiguous one. Baiser is a French verb meaning &#8220;to [expletive]&#8221;, but it also means &#8220;a kiss&#8221; when used as a noun. Baise-moi would be translated as &#8220;[expletive me]&#8221;.
Baise-moi, in this film, can be loosely translated to Kiss Me, [Expletive] Me, or [Expletive] Me, so it&#8217;s not surprising that the film is chock-full of graphic, and usually violent, unsimulated acts. Due to the nature of Baise-moi&#8217;s content, the film was banned in Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. A R18+ version of the movie was approved for Australian audiences in 2013.

We Own The Night (2007)

Fans of the Cuban-American actress Eva Mendes probably wholly approved of this James gray-directed film, specifically one particular scene. In it, an excited Mendes (as character Amada Juarez) performs a rather personal act of self-love when her boyfriend (played by Joaquin Phoenix) walks into the room, sees what she&#8217;s doing, and joins in. Mendes later said in an interview that filming the scene was one of the most nerve-wracking moments of her career.
The film, which boasts even more star power in the form of Mark Wahlberg, Robert Duvall, and Ed Koch, opened to mixed reviews although it was a commercial success in theatres and with DVD sales. Mendes&#8217; racy scene likely didn&#8217;t hurt sales any.

8MM2 (2005)

8MM2, starring Johnathon Schaech and Lori Heuring, was released straight to video and was initially to be titled The Velvet Side of Hell.
In the film, a political candidate suddenly finds himself threatened by a criminal who presents footage of a steamy three-way encounter between himself, his high-society fianc&#233;e, and a Hungarian prostitute. The politician and his fianc&#233; find themselves venturing into a sordid world of pornography and pleasure. All of the provocative scenes in this scandalous movie are completely unsimulated. 8MM2 is also rife with adult language and graphic depictions of drug use, but only has a MPAA rating of R.

Wetlands (2013)

Starring Carla Juri as Helen Memel and Marlen Kruse as best friend Corinna, the film follows a troubled teenager who lives to provoke and irritate others. IMDb describes it as &#8220;the adventures of an eccentric girl who has strange attitudes towards hygiene and sensuality longs for the reunion of her divorced parents.&#8221; Helen has a tendency to use vegetables in an intimate way and falls in love with the nurse who treats her after a shaving accident affecting her private parts. What many movie sites don&#8217;t mention is that the film includes a (totally real) scene of a group of men masturbating onto a pizza. Long story short: Wetlands is not a movie for the faint of heart.

A Real Young Girl (1976)

Catherine Breillat wrote and directed the controversial film, which was based on her novel Le Soupirail. A coming-of-age story featuring 14-year-old Alice, A Real Young Girl depicts many explicit arousing scenes. All were filmed with actors of legal age, but many parts of the movie creep just past our comfort level. This film was so shocking that it was banned by many countries and didn&#8217;t have a theatrical showing until nearly 25 years after its release. One New York Post reviewer said that viewers &#8220;need a rather stronger word than &#8216;explicit&#8217; to describe this long-unreleased, self-consciously provocative film.&#8221;

Blue Movie (1969)

In 1969, the iconic pop artist Andy Warhol directed a film, the appropriately-named Blue Movie. It was the first movie with explicit scenes to receive wide theatrical release. Warhol later explained that the movie was a major influence on Last Tango in Paris, starring Marlon Brando. It also helped usher in the so-called &#8220;Golden Age of Porn&#8221; and the &#8220;porno chic&#8221; trend that came along afterward. The movie depicts one afternoon in the life of a couple as they carouse in bed, chatting about current events between bouts of intercourse. In 1969, staff at NYC&#8217;s Garrick Theatre were arrested and later fined $250 for showing the racy film, which had been deemed &#8220;obscene&#8221;.

The film features many unsimulated private scenes, and is revered for the hunky actors who star in it.
Directed by Jo&#227;o Pedro Rodrigues, O Fantasma won the prize for best feature film in the New York Lesbian & Gay Film Festival and the Entrevues Film Festival. Lead actor Ricardo Meneses was nominated for the 2001 Portuguese Golden Globe award for best leading actor.

Stranger by the Lake (2013)

This French drama has been hailed as a &#8220;dreamlike thriller,&#8221; but make no mistake. The film shows extremely up-front and personal genital close-ups and explicit scenes. The action centers around a lake that becomes a hook-up spot each summer, drawing gay men for guiltless flings and anonymous encounters. But things take a sinister turn when one of the lake&#8217;s frequent visitors witnesses something he should have seen&#8230;
Stranger by the Lake was critically acclaimed and earned Alain Guiraudie an award for Best Director. The movie also won the Queer Palm award and has been nominated for many others.

The film 9 Songs revolves around the love between an American college student named Lisa and a British glaciologist named Matt, played by actors Margo Stilley and Kieran O&#8217;Brien. Premiering at Cannes, 9 Songs received both praise and criticism. The many unsimulated scenes of intimacy between Matt and Lisa caused The Guardian to declare 9 Songs the most explicit mainstream film in the United Kingdom. It received an X rating in Australia. The film is also notable for its footage of concert performances by nine (hence the title) bands, including Franz Ferdinand, The Dandy Warhols, and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.

Antichrist (2009)

This experimental horror film by Lars von Trier features an explicit scene of &#8220;p to v&#8221; interaction, and also includes graphically violent imagery. Body doubles for stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg were used to make the film, but the copulation between those two body doubles was real. Centering around grief, violence, and sadomasochism, the dark Antichrist became the first film in von Trier&#8217;s &#8220;Depression Trilogy.&#8221; At the film&#8217;s Cannes premiere several people fainted at the shocking scenes of violence while others walked out, but it did receive plenty of critical acclaim and awards.
A video game version of Antichrist was in the works but that plan was scrapped in 2011.

The iconic alt rock band Sonic Youth contributed to the soundtrack.

Anatomy of Hell (2004)

This movie features some incredibly jarring images that could be disturbing to many audiences. Directed and narrated by Catherine Breillat, Anatomy of Hell was based on her novel Pornocratie and is said to be a sequel to Romance. In it, the female star (played by Amira Casar) hires a gay man (adult actor Rocco Siffredi) to indulge in four days of depraved acts of sensuality. All these erotic scenes were completely genuine and unsimulated by the film&#8217;s stars. Anatomy of Hell was lauded by some critics but panned by others, with Leonard Maltin calling the film &#8220;homophobic.&#8221;

Otto; Or Up with Dead People (2008)

This is an unexpected Canadian/German film, featuring zombies performing real, unsimulated sex scenes. It&#8217;s like &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221; &#8212; if AMC decided to get a little too real and thought zombies were capable of real intimacy. The movie, starring Marcel Schlutt, Gio Black Peter, Jey Crisfar, and Nicholas Fox Ricciardi, was directed by Bruce LaBruce which means it is guaranteed to be twisted, artsy, and more than a little strange. Otto; or Up with Dead People did not receive critical acclaim, although it did win Best Queer Film at the Merlinka festival International Queer Film Festival in Serbia.

The Idiots (1998)

Director Lars von Trier is a popular name on lists of directors who incorporate unsimulated lovemaking in their films. In The Idiots, a group of anti-bourgeois adults lose seek to drop society&#8217;s trappings by finding their &#8220;inner idiots&#8221; in a suburban home. That, predictably, means a lot of wife-swapping and orgies. Many of the scenes feature real fornication acts and plenty of exposed body parts. Part of von Trier&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Heart Trilogy,&#8221; The Idiots is one of the first films ever to be shot purely digitally. During the movie&#8217;s Cannes premier, one critic was so disgusted he yelled out &#8220;It&#8217;s [expletive]! It&#8217;s [expletive]!&#8221;before he was ejected from the theater.

This film&#8217;s title and director (Lars von Trier) are clear indicators that there are plenty of acts of sensuality depicted throughout. With actors like Christian Slater, Jamie Bell, Uma Thurman, Willem Dafoe, and Shia LaBeouf, Nymphomaniac is the final film in von Trier&#8217;s &#8220;Depression Trilogy&#8221; and was originally five and a half hours long. About the movie, actor LaBeouf said &#8220;[T]here&#8217;s a disclaimer at the top of the script that basically says we&#8217;re doing it for real. Everything that is illegal, we&#8217;ll shoot in blurred images. Other than that, everything is happening. &#8230; [V]on Trier&#8217;s dangerous. He scares me.

Directed by Abel Ferrara, Pasolini stars Willem Dafoe as the title character, film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, during his last days alive (he was murdered in 1975). Pasolini was himself a controversial figure who often tackled taboo subjects. Ferrara initially wanted a female to star as Pasolini, but the actress he selected (Tamerlis Lund) died before he was able to make the version of the film he had envisioned. Pasolini was known for being well-endowed, and it&#8217;s said that Dafoe and the other actors wore prosthetic &#8220;members&#8221; for the film. Pasolini competed for the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival in 2014.

Wild Orchid (1990)

In the 1990s there was no erotic thriller more popular than Wild Orchid. The movie arrived just as Cinemax was airing many adult-themed movies with improved Hollywood production techniques. Wild Orchid stars Mickey Rourke and Carr&#233; Otis started a romantic relationship when they were filming this movie together. That means that their real encounters translated into some very steamy scenes together! Both actors have denied that their love scenes were unsimulated, but director Zalman King has remained &#8220;ambiguous&#8221; on the subject. King had to remove one particularly hot scene in order for the film to receive an R rating from the MPAA.

Love Actually&#8230; Sucks! is a 2012 film that was released in Hong Kong. The movie, based on real events, was directed by Scud (Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung). The film explores some complex and failed relationships, and the director&#8217;s aim was to reveal that life itself, not just romantic relationships, is full of love. The film&#8217;s name was chosen as a play on words for the 2003 Christmas comedy romance movie Love Actually. One IMDb reviewer wrote about Love Actually&#8230; Sucks! &#8220;First, the [explicit] scenes are jarringly explicit, to the extent that they cross over from movie [intimacy] and often become pornography.&#8221;

This movie, directed by Jonas Middleton, most definitely has nothing to do with the &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; franchise. Directed in 1976, the avant-garde film stars Catherine Erhardt as a wealthy socialite named simply &#8220;Catherine&#8221; who is bored with her life and spends much of her time pleasuring herself in the attic in front of a mirror. One day a most unexpected visitor appears in the mirror and engages in explicit acts of sensuality with Catherine. The film was released in art houses throughout Europe and the United States, and was also screened at some festivals.

This avante-garde dramedy by Yugoslavian director Du&#353;an Makavejev tells the stories of two different women. The first is a mute beauty queen who engages in increasingly depraved behavior until she goes completely mad. The second woman is a pedophile who travels in a boat, luring young men and boys with candy before eventually killing them. Only the first woman (the beauty queen) was initially planned for the film but that actress playing her, Carole Laure, became too disgusted by the acts required of her and she quit the production. The candy boat element was added to make up for lost screen time.

Some viewers left the theater because of the steamy scenes they witnessed. Gandu follows a young man of the same name, who is full of rage, as he spirals into a lurid world of drugs, rap, and porn. The film won the Jury Award for Best Film at the South Asian International Film Festival in 2010. Rituparna Sen, who plays one of Gandu&#8217;s acquaintances, is his real-life girlfriend.

The story of a serial killer who targets gay men, Cruising features murder scenes that are cut with explicit footage of men making love. The film&#8217;s sets were also liberally peppered with phallic symbols &#8212; everywhere. Starring Al Pacino, this film was widely dismissed for being homophobic. However, Pacino doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything homophobic about Cruising and insists that he would &#8220;never want to do anything to harm the gay community&#8221;. Tragically, one of the gay bars featured in the film was the setting of an attack conducted by a man with a sub-machine gun. The deranged person killed two of the bar&#8217;s patrons and wounding 12 others.

In the book he said the unadulterated scenes were not rehearsed to ensure they felt as real as humanly possible. The scenes were filmed only with the actors, a photographer, and a technician. According to Rotten Tomatoes, El Topo was initially released as an independent film but John Lennon stepped in and convinced Allen Klein of ABKCO to purchase the movie&#8217;s rights. For years the film was only shown late at night, at arthouse theaters. Its first DVD release was in 2007.

Cry Uncle! is about a private detective who takes on a case that includes blackmail, murder, and adult situations. While the film doesn&#8217;t include actual penetration it does include many other unsimulated acts. Extensive nudity, orgies, drug use, graphic necrophilia, and other explicit acts are frequent, which led to the film being banned in Finland and Sweden when it was first released. It is now considered a cult classic. Director Allen Garfield claims that Cry Uncle! is Oliver Stone&#8217;s favorite comedy film.

The tale follows two Los Angeles detectives as they trail a serial murderer and rapist who is able to evade capture by dressing as a woman. One of the film&#8217;s original taglines was &#8220;Her sensuous young body drove him to commit the ultimate act of lust!&#8221;

Immoral Tales is comprised of four short erotic stories, narrated by director Walerian Borowczyk. Each tale centers around a different theme: self-love, loss of purity, incest, and bloodlust. The stories are graphic in nature and feature some very risqu&#233; images, including one that involves a woman and her pet. The film opened to varied reviews. In 1973, it won the London Festival Choice award at the festival. But in Senses of Cinema magazine, Immoral Tales was described as &#8220;an unsensational approach to the material and detached gaze of the camera make it closer to a surrealist text than a pornographic movie.&#8221;

Viewers watch as she seeks out a variety of erotic situations until she wakes up in a cage and can&#8217;t remember how she got there. Days later, another woman appears in the cage and the two exchange life stories with each other. Caged contains several scenes with adult situations that are rather intense in nature. The scenes in question include the characters taking things &#8220;all the way&#8221; on screen and contain very strong images.

Lust, Caution (2007)

Famed director Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) created this World War II era film about a woman, Wang Jiazhi, who becomes caught up in a dangerous game of emotional intrigue with a political figure. Lust, Caution was based on a 1979 novella by Eileen Chang. The movie was rumored to feature explicit, unsimulated adult situations between actor Tony Leung Chiu Wai and his co-star Tang Wei, and for that reason it was given a NC-17 rating for its United States release. Lee won the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival for Lust, Caution and, earlier, for Brokeback Mountain.

Fruits of Passion (1981)

This 1981 film by Sh&#363;ji Terayama was based on a novel by Pauline R&#233;age, Retour &#224; Roissy. Fruits of Passion contains acts of unsimulated fellatio. In the film, a character named O, played by actress Isabelle Illiers, is placed in a Chinese brothel to complete her &#8220;training.&#8221; While there, she is subjected to various humiliating and sensual experiences in order to exhibit her obedience. There is also a subplot that features some interesting rhetoric about rebellion and resentment towards Europeans. The film received lukewarm reviews, but a digitally remastered version was released in December 2005.

Scandale (1982)

This film was a parody of current events in the Quebec government. A group of workers at the Ministry of Culture, affected by cutbacks, decide to make a few extra dollars by creating their very own blue movie. After finishing their film it unexpectedly gets entered into the Cannes Film Festival, which shocked audiences who were forced to witness a very different side of the government&#8217;s culture than they were aware of. Since Scandale was relevant to the events of 1981, it was released quickly (at a production cost of only $450,000) and is now out of print.

Guardami (1999)

Guardami made its debut at the 56th Venice International Film Festival. It focuses on the real life of Italian adult film actress Moana Pozzi, who is played by Elisabetta Cavallotti. Pozzis is an independent woman who is engaged in a lesbian relationship and has a daughter she&#8217;s raising on her own. The Italian-language film was directed by Davide Ferrario and drew controversy when it showed real, unsimulated oral acts. The adult situations created somewhat of an uproar at the time of the film&#8217;s release in 1999 but would probably not garner more than a blink from today&#8217;s desensitized audiences.

Story of the Eye (2003)

Story of the Eye is based on the 1948 novel Story of the Eye by Georges Bataille. The film is directed by Andrew Repasky McElhinney and contains many hardcore adult scenes. Story of the Eye takes place in an abandoned house where a group of people engage in silent, unsimulated acts of passion. The film received some positive reviews, with the New York Times reporting &#8220;This is transgression in a literal sense, an act of aggression that Bataille would no doubt have appreciated. This is not a movie for passive consumption, but a film that bites back.&#8221;

Enter the Void (2009)

Enter The Void was directed by Gaspar No&#233;, who called it a &#8220;psychedelic melodrama,&#8221; and it contains several very real adult scenes. The 2009 movie is set in Tokyo&#8217;s nightclub scene and follows Oscar, a young American drug dealer who is shot by the police and has an out-of-body experience. Enter the Void was shot from Oscar&#8217;s viewpoint, so frequently features overhead shots, so filming involved extensive crane shots as well as computer-generated imagery. The film was not a success financially, but did win awards at the 2009 Sitges Film Festival and the Neuch&#226;tel Film Festival.

Dogtooth (2009)

Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, this film features some brief, but very real adult encounters. The film delves into the taboo topic of incest, as it tells the story of a girl&#8217;s dysfunctional upbringing that results from her father&#8217;s isolation. The children are forced to stay on their family&#8217;s property in order to remain shielded from the outside world and its &#8220;bad influences.&#8221; The critically-acclaimed film, with its perverse story line, could potentially induce feelings of discomfort among movie watchers. The unsimulated scenes in Dogtooth can cut to the core, and display the type of dysfunction that can develop from isolation and lack of control over one&#8217;s life.

Killer Bitch (2010)

It was executive producer John Fleming who admitted to the real scene of intimacy (featuring adult actor Ben Dover) in this Liam Galvin-directed film. In this 2010 British movie a female is forced into a deadly game in which she must kill five people. If she fails in her mission all of her friends and family will be horribly murdered. Killer Bitch inspired controversy from the time filming began, as rumors spread that the movie was pornographic and glorified rape, a charge the actors denied. The film was not well-received by critics, although some now consider it a cult classic.

Paris 05:59: Th&#233;o & Hugo (2016)

This French film, released in 2016, cuts right to the chase with the first 18 minutes of the film. In it, two men meet at an adult club and engage in a nearly-20-minute unsimulated love scene. They later realize their intimacy had been unprotected and go to a hospital together for an HIV test, and later fall in love as they get to know each other. Variety&#8216;s review of the movie said that the &#8220;biggest talking point will be the 18-minute hardcore gay orgy at the start, yet the film, conceived in real time, is above all a story about what happens when that bolt of lightning called love suddenly strikes.&#8221;

Shortbus (2006)

Shortbus broke many barriers. The film, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell, follows a group of New Yorkers who meet regularly at an artistic and sexual Brooklyn underground salon. The film features plenty of real un-faked scenes. Notably, the film shows close-up penetration and male ejaculation. One character, played by Sook-Yin Lee, is desperate to achieve a climax (which she never has before), and when she finally does the film ends. Director Mitchell once said, &#8220;In the old days, when you couldn&#8217;t show [sensuality] on film, directors like Hitchcock had metaphors&#8230;. such as trains going into tunnels, etc.&#8221;

The Raspberry Reich (2004)

The Raspberry Reich is a 2004 film by director Bruce LaBruce that centers around a terrorist group consisting of a female leader and several young men. LaBruce says that the film is an in-depth look at &#8220;innate radical potential of homosexual expression,&#8221; as well as cult dynamics. The Raspberry Reich is rife with characters participating in multiple acts of intimate expression. From the opening scene until the closing credits, acts of real unsimulated passion are shown in great detail. In 2017 LaBruce released a film titled Ulrike&#8217;s Brain, which the director says is intended to be a sort of prequel to The Raspberry Reich.

In this film, a friendship forms between a 21 year-old woman named Jane and an older woman named Sadie, when Jane discovers some money in an object at Sadie&#8217;s yard sale. Directed by Sean S. Baker, Starlet contains just one scene of an unsimulated connection. The film&#8217;s star, Dree Hemingway, used a body double for the infamous love scene and says that the experience altered the way she perceives the porn industry. The scene was edited so professionally that you wouldn&#8217;t know it was actually Zoe Voss in the act, along with a fellow colleague from the adult industry.

Pink Flamingos (1972)

John Waters&#8217; cult classic film broke many boundaries, but one scene in particular is notable for the purposes of this list. In it, legendary drag queen Divine gives unsimulated head to her son in the film. The actor playing her son wasn&#8217;t actually related to her, but the dirty deed was definitely real. Not for the faint of heart!
Roger Ebert said of the film, &#8220;Pink Flamingos appeals to that part of our psyches in which we are horny teenagers at the county fair with fresh dollar bills in our pockets, and a desire to see the geek show with a bunch of buddies, so that we can brag about it at school on Monday.&#8221;

Sweet Sweetback&#8217;s Baadasssss Song (1971)

Decades after the film premiered, star Melvin Van Peebles confessed to actual lovemaking in the groundbreaking blaxploitation film. He also candidly admitted to contracting gonorrhea during filming. That&#8217;s serious method acting.
Even more disturbing, the film&#8217;s opening scene depicts a 13-year-old Sweetback, played by Van Peebles&#8217; son Mario, losing his virginity. Mario later said that he was forced to take part in the scene by his father, who simply wanted to complete his film. Adding to the skeevy factor is the fact that the film was funded with a loan from the disgraced Bill Cosby.

In the Realm of the Senses (1976)

In this true story of insatiable erotic desire, In the Realm of the Senses director Nagisa Oshima created one of the most controversial films of all time. The film also contains many gruesome scenes which were, luckily, re-enactments though all the physical intimacy depicted was 100% real.
In an article written shortly after Oshima&#8217;s 2013 death, Dana Stevens of Slate wrote: &#8220;In the Realm of the Senses is a film like no other, a magical fusion of art and pornography that somehow renders debates about the distinction between those two categories boringly beside the point.&#8221;

Romance (1999)

Romance is an especially graphic movie featuring multiple acts of completely unsimulated interactions. Starring Caroline Ducey, the movie received a very high rating in Canada. An arthouse film, Romance follows the journey of a young woman, Marie, who lives with her boyfriend Paul. Paul refuses any intimacy with her, so Marie searches for it in unusual places. She becomes promiscuous and winds up participating in sadomasochism with an older man, in scenes that were completely unfeigned. The movie also contains a (brief) ejaculation shot. Written and directed by Catherine Breillat, the film was edited to receive an R rating before being shown in America.

James Joyce&#8217;s Women (1985)

This film follows the life of James Joyce&#8217;s wife Nora. It also looks at some of the other (real) women in his life as well as some fictional women from the writer&#8217;s novels. Irish Author Fionnula Flanagan both wrote and starred in the film, as Nora and as several other characters, making James Joyce&#8217;s Women almost a one-woman show. It was directed by Michael Pearce.
In one particularly notable scene, Flanagan (as character Molly Bloom) pleasures herself in a bed for nearly 20 minutes. She&#8217;s nude during the act. An LA Times review of the film praised the scene: &#8220;Flanagan&#8217;s Molly, in fact, is a great summation of what it means to be a woman&#8211;what it means, indeed, to live.&#8221;

In this comedy starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Steve Carell, and Jennifer Aniston, Carrey&#8217;s character &#8220;Bruce&#8221; gets to be God for one week. During that week, Bruce uses his godly powers to give Aniston&#8217;s character &#8220;Grace&#8221; a mind-blowing climax while she&#8217;s in the bathroom. Aniston delivered a super-realistic representation in the scene. She could have been paying homage to Meg Ryan&#8217;s similarly convincing performance in the 1989 comedy film When Harry Met Sally. Although Aniston remains clothed in the Bruce Almighty scene, she&#8217;s been known to bare her body in other movies and calls the act &#8220;liberating.&#8221;

In Little Ashes, Pattinson plays artist Salvador Dal&#237;, who enters into a love affair with his friend, the poet Federico Garc&#237;a Lorca (played by actor Javier Beltr&#225;n). Pattinson acts in a scene depicting some serious self-loving. When people commented that he did a really convincing job in that particular part of the film, Pattinson openly replied that faking it &#8220;just doesn&#8217;t work, so I pleasured myself in front of the camera. My o-face is recorded for eternity.&#8221; Wow.

The Danish film All About Anna, starring Mark Stevens and Gry Bay, is billed as a film about intimate relationships, which means it&#8217;s chock-full of erotic scenes. In response to public outcry over unsimulated intercourse and masturbation, director Jessica Nilsson defended the film by saying &#8220;without the sex scenes, the film&#8217;s drama would fall apart.&#8221; The film was released on DVD in 2005, and did not have its theatrical premiere until 2007, when it was shown as part of a series called Cinematic Sexualities in the 21st Century. All About Anna was critically acclaimed and won several awards worldwide.

Ecstasy (1933)

In the 1933 black and white film Ecstasy, actress Hedy Lamarr writhes in such obvious joy that the movie was banned in the United States for nearly 30 years after its release. In fact, the film was dubbed &#8220;The Most Talked About Picture in the World,&#8221; and it was the first movie to depict a female&#8217;s intense pleasure so clearly. Lamarr&#8217;s first husband, Friedrich Mandl, was so scandalized and upset by the film that he unsuccessfully attempted to block its release by buying every copy of it (at a cost of $280,000 &#8212; $5.18 million in 2017 dollars).

Starring Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas, this film is a remake of Fran&#231;ois Truffaut&#8217;s 1969 Mississippi Mermaid. Original Sin takes place in 19th century Cuba. In it, Banderas&#8217; character Luis Vargas orders an American mail order bride (Jolie&#8217;s character Julia Russell) and they are married almost immediately upon her arrival in Cuba. The film features a convincingly passionate love scene that has left many viewers wondering if the action was really happening between the two. The segment in question takes place in a hot and steamy bathtub, adding to the realism and sensual quality of the scene.

The movie also contains a racy love scene between Johansson and Gabriel Macht, and many fans believe that she truly enjoyed every minute of the action. A Love Song For Bobby Long was written and directed by Shainee Gabel, and is set in steamy New Orleans. Johansson&#8217;s role earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a motion picture drama.

Barbarella (1968)

Legendary actress Jane Fonda starred in the iconic 1968 film Barbarella, which was directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim. Fonda acts the part of the &#8220;highly sensual&#8221; Barbarella convincingly well throughout the movie and its many hookup scenes. There&#8217;s one memorable scene depicting a device called the Excessive Machine (or &#8216;Orgasmostron&#8217; in French) that&#8217;s intended to kill her with pleasure, but the insatiable Barbarella outlasts it. The film remains a cult classic, and many remakes and sequels have been proposed.
Interesting note: Director Roger Vadim considered casting actresses Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren in the title role before settling on his wife.

Show Me Love is a very tame version of this film&#8217;s original Swedish title, one that was created for English distribution. The coming of age movie follows two teenage girls as they embark on a sensual relationship with each other. One particularly steamy scene takes place in the backseat of a car. The original title, [Expletive] &#197;m&#229;l, was changed to the less risqu&#233; Show Me Love ahead of the Academy Awards, when the film was Sweden&#8217;s candidate for the year. Variety magazine refused to advertise the naughtier title to promote the movie, but Show Me Love was not nominated in the end anyway.

For 2010&#8217;s psychological thriller-horror film Black Swan, directed by Darren Aronofsky, co-stars Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis were indeed method actors&#8230; but not for their super steamy love scenes (although Portman nailed her self-love performance). No, the two trained for the dark film for more than six months, learning ballet and working out to attain genuine ballerina figures.
Their rigorous training involved exercising for many hours a day. Kunis reportedly lost more than 20 pounds during their training, saying, &#8220;this is very different because you can&#8217;t fake it&#8230;.Your whole body has to be structured differently.&#8221; Portman won Best Actress for the film and Aronofsky was nominated for Best Director.

The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)

There were plenty of memorable scenes in this Martin Scorsese-directed film based on true events. But Margot Robbie&#8217;s scene of self-gratification as she&#8217;s taunting her husband Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) particularly stands out.
Robbie&#8217;s character, Naomi Lapaglia, crawls around on the floor in a tantalizingly short skirt with nothing underneath. She exposes herself to Belfort and begins to stroke herself, appearing to enjoy every minute. Robbie received critical praise for her performance, with one critic writing, &#8220;She&#8217;s Scorsese&#8217;s best blonde bombshell discovery since Cathy Moriarty in Raging Bull. Robbie is funny, hard and kills every scene she&#8217;s in.&#8221; So, the question remains &#8212; was she faking it or not?

Basic Instinct (1992), Sliver (1993), Basic Instinct 2 (2006)

Sharon Stone starred in all three films and really pushed the boundaries in them. In 1992&#8217;s Basic Instinct, it&#8217;s widely believed that Stone and her co-star Michael Douglas were really doing the deed during their love scene. They were very convincing if merely acting.
Also in Basic Instinct, Stone revealed a very intimate body part &#8211; fully nude. According to Stone, the interrogation scene was supposed to feature only the innuendo of nudity. When Stone found out that her exposed crotch was pictured, she was so furious that she supposedly slapped the director. And who can forget Stone&#8217;s ultra-realistic portrayals of self-love acts in both Sliver and Basic Instinct 2? We think it&#8217;s safe to say there was some real pleasure happening in both scenes.

In David Lynch&#8217;s haunting thriller Mulholland Drive, a gorgeous aspiring actress (Betty, played by Naomi Watts) has just moved to Los Angeles and finds herself quickly wrapped in a dark narrative.
In one steamy scene, Betty engages in a deeply personal act of self-love. Many viewers are convinced that her pleasure is genuine. This is in part because Watts cries during the scene, despite director Lynch not asking her to, which would indicate that she is experiencing true passion. She has said in later interviews that she was simply nervous to participate in the scene, but either way it was a convincing performance.

Director Adrian Lyne is credited with bringing S & M onto the big screen and into the mainstream with his steamy 1986 film 9 &#189; Weeks. Although the movie didn&#8217;t perform well at the box office, it sold lots of DVDs and now has a cult following of fans.
Many of those fans are convinced that the torrid love scenes between stars Kim Basigner and Mickey Rourke were genuine and not acted. There&#8217;s also a very believable act of self-love that Basigner appeared to receive real pleasure from. Lyne denies that any of the love scenes were real, but that doesn&#8217;t stop fans from believing the rumors.

The To Do List (2013)

This film, which stars Aubrey Plaza, Bill Hader, Alia Shawkat, Sarah Steele and Rachel Bilson, follows Plaza&#8217;s character (Brandy Klark) as she prepares to head to college.
Brandy feels she is too inexperienced in bedroom matters and wants to lose her virginity before school starts. In one memorable scene, she engages in a graphic act of self-love. Rumor has it that director Maggie Carey wanted Plaza to genuinely perform the act, so the scene is all real. Fellow actor Rachel Bilson has said &#8220;She just went for it all. It takes a lot of courage and a lot of confidence to hump a pillow&#8221; about the challenging scene.

American Reunion (2012)

The sequel to the uproarious American Pie, this film is just as funny and raunchy. Actress Alyson Hannigan first became a household name in the original movie with her &#8220;band camp&#8221; story. In American Reunion, she takes things one step further and indulges in some quite realistic self-love in the bathtub.
Her sighs and the way she rocks back and forth are indicators that she could have been actually performing the dirty deed under all those bubbles. Unfortunately, her husband (played by Jason Biggs) bursts in and startles her, putting an end to the fun self-love session.

Not Another Teen Movie (2001)

Ouch, this one is cringeworthy but hilarious! In it, Chyler Leigh, playing awkward teen Janey Briggs, is lying in bed. She begins to pleasure herself with a special pulsating toy as she watches a Freddie Prinze flick. Sounds like it could be kind of hot, right?
Suddenly her dad, brother, grandparents, family priest and dog burst in, to wish her a surprise happy birthday. Not exactly the audience you want to entertain while you&#8217;re enjoying some birthday self-lovin.&#8217; Leigh went on to roles in shows like Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and Supergirl, so apparently filming the embarrassing scene didn&#8217;t put her off acting for good.

The Brown Bunny (2003)

This film was notable because it featured genuine hanky panky by a major Hollywood star. In one scene Chlo&#235; Sevigny&#8217;s character went down on her real-life boyfriend Vincent Gallo, which caused an absolute uproar. Sevigny later told Playboy that she experienced &#8220;a lot of emotions [about the scene]. I&#8217;ll probably have to go to therapy at some point.&#8221; Film critic Roger Ebert called The Brown Bunnythe worst film in the history of Cannes, although after viewing a re-edited version of the film later gave the film his signature &#8220;thumbs up.&#8221; The Brown Bunny was quite a personal endeavor for Gallo, as he wrote, produced, filmed, directed, and edited the film.

Love (2015)

Nothing is left to the imagination in director Gaspar No&#233;&#8217;s film, which is remarkable for being released in 3-D. One reviewer, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, wrote that &#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between being naked before an audience and showing them your [expletive], and No&#233; does the latter&#8212;very literally, in close-up and 3-D.&#8221; Half the film takes place in bed, with unblinking, extended takes. The director gets up close and personal in order to express the deeper mysteries of relationships. No&#233; faced a lot of criticism, namely because his previous films had received such high acclaim in the film world. People had high hopes that he would break boundaries and redefine acting and cinema with Love.

Lie with Me (2005)

When audiences commented that the action between Lauren Lee Smith and Eric Balfour looked very real, everyone on set admitted that it was. Actress Lauren Lee Smith said of the film, &#8220;It&#8217;s controversial, but it&#8217;s also something everyone will understand. It&#8217;s about a woman who is not so comfortable with the emotional side of relationships, but is so good with the physical &#8230;side. Taking the role wasn&#8217;t about the &#8216;naked chick&#8217; quality &#8211; it&#8217;s about showing strong &#8230;women.&#8221; Lauren can also be seen in &#8220;The L Word&#8221;, &#8220;The Listener&#8221;, and &#8220;CSI.&#8221; Balfour has appeared in &#8220;24,&#8221; &#8220;Monk,&#8221; and &#8220;Haven.&#8221;

Caligula (1979)

Caligula was based on the real life exploits of the notoriously insane and lustful Roman Emperor. It features plenty of explicit group activities, including penetration, fellatio and ejaculation.
The film is called one of the most obscene mainstream movies ever, and IMDb&#8217;s Parental Guide states that &#8220;No child should ever watch it, and several adults will have trouble with it. The film&#8217;s risqu&#233; content is considered pornographic in nature, with several hardcore inserts intended to sensually arouse, but really turn out to be quite disturbing.&#8221; There are several versions of the film, from the original 160-minute cut to an abbreviated 90-minute long one.

Intimacy (2001)

Intimacy is a British film that follows two strangers in an amorous adventure. Jay, a bartender, doesn&#8217;t even know the name of the woman when they first get together but they soon engage in weekly anonymous acts of the &#8220;happy-happy.&#8221; Eventually, the two learn more about one another and develop feelings for each other. The many &#8220;happy&#8221; scenes between stars Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox are all completely unsimulated.
Fox later said she has no regrets about performing the explicit scenes, and that she&#8217;s proud of the film as one of her finest ever. She won a best actress award at the 2001 Berlin Film Festival for the role.
